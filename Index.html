        <p>The Transfăgărășan was constructed between 1970 and 1974 during the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu as a response to the 1968
        invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union.Ceaușescu wanted to ensure quick military access across the mountains
        in case of a Soviet invasion. The Transfăgărășan was featured in a segment of the British TV show Top Gear, in the first episode of Series 14
        (November 2009). Host Jeremy Clarkson proclaimed that the Transfăgărășan was "the best road in the world, a title
        the presenters had previously given to the Stelvio Pass in Italy. The road has also been dubbed "Ceaușescu's Folly".</p>
